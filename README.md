## Quick Start

Coming soon, once first numbered release is added.

📖 **[Full deployment guide →](DEPLOY.md)**

---

## Features

**Write together, or alone.** Jump in on any device with the real time sync server, or collaborate in real-time with other writers, or work entirely locally with no server. 

**Build your world as you write.** Create characters, locations, factions — whatever your story needs. Link them together with relationships, and reference them directly in your prose with @mentions.

**Own your data.** Many hosting options are supported.  Native sync server binaries (thanks to Bun), self contained Docker images, and support for Cloudflare free tier deployment.

**Export when you're ready.** PDF, EPUB, Markdown, HTML. Configurable publish plans let you publish multiple asset variants from a single project.

## Status

### Unreleased 

- Can be deployed and used now, however, until numbered releases are started, there are no guarantees that data migration paths will be available.  
- Not recommended for production use.   If you do use it in this way, always back up your work before upgrading, and be aware, manual fixing of exports might be needed to move to newer versions.  
- At some point closer to the first numbered release, the drizzle migrations will be squashed into a single V1 migration, meaning existing databases will need to be reset or manually fixed.

## Architecture

Inkweld has two parts that can run together or separately:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Browser["YOUR BROWSER"]
        Client["Angular PWA"]
        Editor["Rich text editor (ProseMirror)"]
        Offline["Offline storage (IndexedDB)"]
        Client --- Editor
        Client --- Offline
    end

    subgraph Server["SERVER (optional)"]
        API["Hono API on Bun"]
        Auth["User auth & projects"]
        DB["SQLite + LevelDB"]
        API --- Auth
        API --- DB
    end

    Client <-->|"REST + WebSocket"| API
```

**The client** is where you write. It's a full web app that works offline.

**The server** enables sharing and sync. Run it on your own hardware or a VPS. Without it, you can still use Inkweld locally — documents save to your browser.

---

## Development

### Requirements

- [Bun 1.3+](https://bun.sh/)
- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobbyquantum/inkweld.git
cd inkweld
bun install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `:4200`, backend on `:8333`.

### Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Dev servers | `npm run dev` |
| Run tests | `npm test` |
| Build | `npm run build` |
| Docker | `npm run compose:up:prod` |

## Data Security & AI Stance

Inkweld is self-hosted — the content on your server doesn't leave your server and any browsers you connect with.  

The exception to this are if you use external AI services.  There's an **AI Kill Switch** that disables all AI features, and AI is disabled by default.   

If you choose to enable AI features, you can configure both self hosted services and external services, and uses include image generation based on content, and grammar suggestions.  

You should be aware when using external AI services that content could be used to train, and in the case of some providers, even be published or sold as training data sets.

> Always check the provider policies when configuring AI features.

## AI Usage Disclosure

**Disclosure:** GitHub Copilot and Claude Code is used in development (a lot). The desktop background image in the main app is currently AI-generated.  Some of the examples in the docs use generative AI for images and text. 

The main logo is not AI, this was hand-drawn in Inkscape as SVG.
