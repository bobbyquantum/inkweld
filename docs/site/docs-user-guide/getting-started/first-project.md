# Creating Your First Project

Ready to start writing? Creating a project in Inkweld is a two-step process: choose a template, then enter your project details.

## Step 1: Click the Create Button

From the bookshelf, click the **+ Create** button in the top navigation bar. This takes you to the project creation page.

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/generated/create-button-nav"
  alt="Create button in the navigation bar"
/>

## Step 2: Choose a Template

The first step is selecting a template that defines your project's starting structure:

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/generated/create-project-templates"
  alt="Template selection screen"
/>

Templates provide different starting points:

| Template | Best For | What You Get |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Empty Project** | Complete flexibility | A blank project with no pre-created folders |
| **Novel** | Fiction writers | Chapters folder, character & location worldbuilding |
| **Worldbuilding** | World creators | Organized folders for characters, locations, factions, lore |
| **Demo Project** | Learning Inkweld | Sample content showing all features |

:::tip Try the Demo
If you're new to Inkweld, start with the **Demo Project** template. It includes example content that shows how to use all the features.
:::

Select your template and click **Next** to continue.

## Step 3: Enter Project Details

Now enter the basic information for your project:

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/generated/create-project-details"
  alt="Project details form"
/>

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Title** | Display name for your project | "The Dragon's Legacy" |
| **Slug** | URL-safe identifier (auto-generated) | `the-dragons-legacy` |
| **Description** | Short summary or tagline (optional) | "An epic fantasy adventure" |

The **slug** is automatically generated from your title. It's used in URLs like `inkweld.example.com/username/the-dragons-legacy`.

Click **Create Project** when you're ready.

## You're In!

After creation, you're taken directly into your new project. What you see depends on your chosen template:

- **Empty/Novel templates**: A clean workspace ready for your content
- **Worldbuilding template**: Pre-organized folders for your world
- **Demo template**: Example content you can explore and modify
