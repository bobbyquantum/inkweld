# The Bookshelf

The Bookshelf is your home in Inkweld — a visual library of all your writing projects, displayed as a collection of book covers.

## Your Project Library

When you log in, you'll see your projects displayed as book covers on a virtual bookshelf:

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/generated/bookshelf-desktop"
  alt="Inkweld bookshelf showing project covers"
/>

### Project Covers

Each project appears as a book cover on the shelf:

- **Custom covers** — Upload your own cover image for a personalized look
- **Generated covers** — Projects without a custom cover display a styled placeholder with the project title

### Collaboration Indicator

Projects shared with you by other users display a **group icon** badge, making it easy to distinguish your own projects from collaborative ones. Hover over the badge to see who shared the project with you.

## Navigation

### Top Bar

The top navigation provides quick access to:

- **Search** — Find projects by title (click the search icon on mobile)
- **+ Create** — Start a new project
- **User Menu** — Access your settings, messages, and logout

### Mobile View

On mobile devices, the bookshelf adapts to a scrollable carousel view:

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/generated/bookshelf-mobile"
  alt="Inkweld bookshelf on mobile"
/>

## Opening a Project

Simply click any project cover to open it. You'll be taken directly into the project's editor view where you can start writing.
