# Customizing Output

Publish plans include metadata and options that control how your export looks.

## Metadata

Metadata appears in the generated file's properties and, for EPUB, in e-reader displays.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Book Title** | Appears as the document/book title |
| **Author** | Your name or pen name |
| **Language** | Content language code (e.g., "en", "es") |
| **Description** | Summary or blurb (used in EPUB metadata) |

Fill these in the "Book Metadata" section of your publish plan.

## Options

The "Options" section controls what's included:

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Include Table of Contents** | Adds a TOC page at the start |
| **Include Cover Page** | Adds your project cover image |

If "Include Cover Page" is enabled and you have a project cover set, it will be used. You can also specify a custom cover image URL.

## Content Order

Documents appear in your export in the order they're listed in the Contents section:

- Drag items to reorder
- Use the arrow buttons to move items up/down
- The TOC (if added) is typically placed first

## Cover Images

For cover images to appear:

1. Set a project cover in your project settings (see [Project Covers](/user-guide/media/covers))
2. Enable "Include Cover Page" in your publish plan options

The cover is embedded in EPUB exports and appears as a title page in PDF/HTML.

## What You Can't Customize (Yet)

Current limitations:

- **Typography** — Font, size, and spacing are fixed per format
- **Page layout** — PDF uses default margins and page size
- **Scene breaks** — The break style is fixed
- **Chapter numbering** — Not currently available

These may be added in future versions.
