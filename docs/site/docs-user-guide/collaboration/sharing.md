# Sharing Projects

Project owners can invite other users to collaborate. Access the Collaboration tab in Project Settings to manage collaborators.

## Access Levels

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control—edit content, manage settings, invite/remove collaborators, delete the project |
| **Editor** | Create, edit, and delete documents and worldbuilding entries |
| **Viewer** | Browse and read all content (no editing) |

## Inviting Collaborators

1. Open your project and go to **Settings → Collaboration**
2. Click **Invite Collaborator**
3. Enter their username and select a role (Editor or Viewer)
4. Click **Invite**

The invited user receives a pending invitation. Once they accept, they can access the project according to their role.

## Managing Collaborators

In the Collaboration tab you can:

- **View current collaborators** with their roles and invitation status
- **Change roles** using the dropdown next to each collaborator
- **Remove collaborators** to revoke their access immediately

## Requirements

- Collaborators must have an account on the same Inkweld instance
- Their account must be active (approved, if user approval is enabled)
- You need to know their exact username

## Troubleshooting

**Can't find a user to invite?**  
Verify the exact username spelling. The user must already have an account on this instance.

**Collaborator can't access the project?**  
Check that their invitation status is "Accepted" and their account is active. Try removing and re-inviting them.
