# User Settings

User settings control your Inkweld experience across all projects. Open the settings dialog from the user menu in the top navigation.

## Connection Settings

Manage how Inkweld connects to a server or works offline.

### Server Mode

When connected to a server:
- View your current server URL
- Enter a new server URL to switch servers
- Switch to offline mode (disconnects from server)

### Offline Mode

When working offline:
- Migrate projects to a server when you're ready to connect
- Create an account or log in during migration
- Projects sync automatically after migration

## Project Tree Settings

Control behavior when organizing your project structure.

### Confirm Element Moves

When enabled, Inkweld asks for confirmation before moving documents or folders in the project tree. This prevents accidental reorganization.

## Editor Settings

Customize your writing environment.

### Zen Mode Fullscreen

When enabled, Zen mode expands to fill your entire screen for distraction-free writing. When disabled, Zen mode stays within the app window.

### Use Tabs on Desktop

When enabled, open documents appear in tabs at the top of the editor area. When disabled, only the current document is shown.
