# Navigation

Navigate your project using the project tree in the left sidebar.

## Project Tree

The project tree shows all your documents, folders, and worldbuilding elements in a hierarchical structure.

### Basic Navigation

- **Click** an item to open it in a new tab
- **Double-click** a folder to expand/collapse it
- **Right-click** for context menu options
- **Drag and drop** to reorganize elements

### Keyboard Navigation

| Key           | Action                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `↑` `↓`       | Move selection up/down          |
| `←`           | Collapse folder or go to parent |
| `→`           | Expand folder                   |
| `Enter`       | Open selected item              |

### Toolbar Buttons

At the top of the project tree:

- **New Document** — Create a new element (opens type chooser)
- **New Folder** — Create a folder directly
- **Collapse All** — Collapse all expanded folders

## Element References

Use `@mentions` to navigate between connected elements:

1. Type `@` in any document
2. Search for characters, locations, or items
3. Select to insert a clickable reference
4. Click any reference to jump to that element

See [Element References](../worldbuilding/element-references) for details.

## Tabs

Open documents appear as tabs at the top of the editor. Click tabs to switch between open documents. Right-click a tab for options like Close, Close Others, or Rename.

## Project-wide Search

Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F` (or click the search icon in the sidebar toolbar) to search across **all documents** in your project at once. Results show matching snippets with the search term highlighted, and clicking a result opens that document directly.

See [Project Search](./project-search) for full details.

## Find in Document

Press `Ctrl/Cmd + F` while editing a document to open the find bar. This lets you search for text within the current document, navigate between matches, and optionally replace text. See [The Editor — Find and Replace](../writing/editor#find-and-replace) for full details.

## Media Search

The [Media Library](../media/library) includes a search bar to find images and files by name or AI generation prompt.
