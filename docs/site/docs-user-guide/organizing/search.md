# Navigation

Navigate your project using the project tree in the left sidebar.

## Project Tree

The project tree shows all your documents, folders, and worldbuilding elements in a hierarchical structure.

### Basic Navigation

- **Click** an item to open it in a new tab
- **Double-click** a folder to expand/collapse it
- **Right-click** for context menu options
- **Drag and drop** to reorganize elements

### Keyboard Navigation

| Key           | Action                          |

### Toolbar Buttons

At the top of the project tree:
