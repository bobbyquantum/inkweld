## Real-Time Collaboration

Work together with co-authors, beta readers, and editors in real-time. Inkweld uses **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** to ensure everyone sees changes instantly without conflicts.

- **Live editing** — See changes as collaborators type
- **No conflicts** — Write simultaneously without version issues
- **Automatic sync** — Changes sync when you reconnect

## Offline-First

Write anywhere, even without an internet connection.

- **Full offline support** — Continue writing when disconnected
- **Local storage** — Documents cached for instant access
- **Seamless sync** — Changes merge automatically when you're back online

## Worldbuilding Tools

Build rich fictional worlds with structured element types.
