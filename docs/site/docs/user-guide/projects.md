## Project Structure

### Folders

Organize your work with folders:

### Documents

Create different types of documents:

- **Text documents** - For chapters, scenes, and prose
- **Worldbuilding entries** - Structured elements for your story world
- **Notes** - For research, outlines, and planning

## Worldbuilding Elements

Inkweld uses a flexible **element system** for worldbuilding. Elements are structured entries that you define to match your story's needs—characters, locations, factions, items, magic systems, or anything else your world requires.

### Creating Elements

1. Right-click in your project tree
2. Select **"New Worldbuilding Entry"**
3. Choose a template or create a new one
4. Fill in the structured fields

:::tip Element References
Once you've created elements, use `@` mentions in your documents to link to them. See [Element References](./element-references) for details.
:::

### Templates

Every worldbuilding element uses a template that defines its structure. Templates are fully customizable:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Templates**
2. Click **"Create Template"**
3. Define custom tabs and fields
4. Use your template for new entries

Examples of templates you might create:

- **Character** - Names, descriptions, personality, backstory
- **Location** - Settings with descriptions, history, notable features
- **Faction** - Organizations, governments, or groups
- **Item** - Artifacts, weapons, or magical objects
- **Event** - Historical moments or timeline entries
- **Species** - Races, creatures, or beings in your world

Inkweld includes a few demo templates to help you get started, but you can modify these or create entirely new ones to match your story's unique needs.

3. **Changes save locally** automatically
4. **Reconnect** - Changes sync automatically

### Sync Status

Check your sync status:
